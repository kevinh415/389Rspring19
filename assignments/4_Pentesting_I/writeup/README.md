## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

FLAG: CMSC389R-{d1gging_f0r_flag5_thr0ugh_1njec7ion}

I went to Google and typed in "command injection shell command" because I knew that we had to use command injection and access shell commands to get the flag. I found a website from wonderhowto.com titled "Use Command Injection to Pop a Reverse Shell on a Web Server." In step 2 of the blog, the author talked about using the && command to chain commands, so I tried a simple "ls" command paired with the 1337bank.money domain after calling nc 1337bank.money 1337. The command worked and displayed the directories, so I modified the commands to get the flag. In the end, the command was "1337bank.money && cd home && cat flag.txt.

### Part 2 (60 pts)

Step 2 wanted the four following actions: shell, pull, help, and quit. I got the user input using raw_input() and used if statements to determine what action to do. For "shell", I used the socket calls and used command injection to "unlock" the interactive shell after doing some googling on what command to use. However, the interactive shell only accepted one command, so I used a while loop while the input was not "exit" to continue with the chain of commands by the user. I ran into some problems where the code would get stuck, and discovered that the recv() method was causing this error when I called "cd". To fix this problem, I used if statements to handle different commands by the user. 

For the "pull" command, I used split() to split the inputs since the pull command has two directories in it. I created a method called "copy" which would return the string from the directory that I could then copy into the new file. This step was similar to the shell command, but I directly use "cat" and the file location to get the string and return it. In my main method, I cd into the correct directory that I want to copy the file into and use the file open and write command to create a new file and copy the data into it. 

If the command is anything else except for "quit", I print the "help" manual that explains what each command does. If the command is "quit", then I simply return a new line since it quits out of the shell.
