### Part 2 (75 pts)

If I found a security flaw in the ECU's firmware that could potentially endanger the occupants of the vehicle, then I would immediately pass along the information to my boss. I would explain to him the dangers that could arise from releasing the firmware and urge him to contact the higher ups to delay the release. The potential danger that could arise from the exploits should be prioritized over the planned release date. It is more beneficial for both the company and the customers if the launch is delayed in favor of a more secure product. Although the company would benefit in the short-term if the firmware is released on time, it is not worth the risk. In the worst case, the firmware will get exploited and endanger human lives, ruining the company's reputation. Even if the firmware is not exploited, the employees will still know about the decision and it may hamper with the overall atmosphere and culture of the company. Additionally, one of the employees could tell a journalist of what the company did and it would damage the company's reputation. 

If my boss told the higher ups but they refuse to delay the firmware's release, then I would probably try to find a way to delay the release. It depends on the severity of the exploits and how hard it is to exploit, but if I believe that there is enough of a chance for the exploit to endanger lives, then I would contact a news outlet. This may put my career at risk, but it wouldn't cause any problems when applying for other jobs because what I did was justified. If I end up not doing anything and the exploits cause harm on the customers, then I would definitely play a role in the harm that results. I had the ability to delay the release but didn't, which makes me partly responsible for the consequences.
