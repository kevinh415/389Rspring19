## Assignment Writeup

### Part 1 (40 pts)

In order to extract this information from Elizabeth, I would call her phone number pretending to be a researcher who is interested in the relationship between the success of an individual and their lifestyle. Since Elizabeth is the CEO of her banking company, I believe that she would be more than happy to assist the researcher. I would tell her that I would ask her simple and easy questions first to get warmed up before I go more in-depth. In between the questions, I’ll ask about her mother’s maiden name, where she was born, what browser she uses, and if she has any pets, as well as their names. The range of questions that I will ask initially and the number of other questions that are focused on the relationship between the success of the individual and their lifestyle will mask the true purpose of obtaining these information. After the survey, I would contact Elizabeth’s credit card company, saying that I am her husband and I forgot the pin number to the ATM. Meanwhile, I would have background noise of people and cars so it creates a sense of urgency, and I would say that Elizabeth is in the hospital so she is to respond to me. With the questionnaire from before, I would have enough information to pretend to be Elizabeth’s husband.


### Part 2 (60 pts)

One vulnerability is the password. The current password is too common, so the hackers can simply input a list of common passwords and find the password. I would recommend changing the password into something longer and less predictable. For more tips on how to make your passwords more secure, I would advise you to check out this post from McAfee: https://securingtomorrow.mcafee.com/consumer/family-safety/15-tips-to-better-password-security/.  Another vulnerability is the exposed port. Hackers can find open ports using port scanners and brute force their way into the system. One solution to prevent hackers from brute forcing their way into the system is to use a port knocking. Put simply, port knocking is a method used to defend yourself against port scanners. When using port knocking, the port will only open when a series of predetermined ports are requested in sequence. Here's an article explaining port-knocking more in-depth as well as a tutorial: https://medium.com/secjuice/how-to-hide-your-ports-with-port-knocking-cb7f244849e7. The third vulnerability is the repetition of the username "v0idcache". If you use the same username across all websites and social media, then the attackers will be able to easily find connections between your accounts. For example, if the attackers only know of your github page, but you have a Twitter with the same username, then they can find more information about you by accessing the Twitter account. Your Twitter account is linked to your name, which they can then use to find you on Facebook. I would recommend using different usernames for different websites, especially for the social media platforms.
